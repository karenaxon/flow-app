#### By Karen Axon


## Technologies Used

* Cadence
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
* Flow Client Library (FCL)
* React
* Javascript
* Typescript
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap

## Setup/Installation 

* Click on the [repository's](https://github.com/karenaxon/flow-app.git) link.
* Click on the green "Code" button and copy the repository URL.
* Open your terminal and navigate to the location where you would like to clone the application.
* Use the command _git clone https://github.com/karenaxon/flow-app.git_ to clone the repository.
* From the root directory of the application run the following commands:
  
  ```npm install```

## Using the Application

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
